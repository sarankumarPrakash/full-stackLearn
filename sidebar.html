    <form><p>Lions belong to the Felidae family, a cat family known as the giant cats. The cat family comprises lions, tigers, leopards, panthers, and jaguars, but the lions are considered the most powerful. The lion is regarded as one of the bravest animals and looks hefty. They are also called the king of the jungle. Male lions have a mane that gives them a bulky appearance, but the mane is absent in female lions. Lions live in groups called ‘pride’ and live in grasslands and open woodlands. A pride usually comprises five to thirty lions. The pride comprises a few male lions, and the rest are lionesses and their cubs. Lions are very protective when it comes to their family, their cubs, and their places of survival. They can fight for their survival as well as for their cubs. Lions hunt together and live together and sleep for more than 20 hours. Lions are found in India’s Gir Forest, and India is famed for being the home of these animals. They can also be found in Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, and other parts of Africa.</p> <button class="but1"><a href="sidebar2.html">Log In</a></button></form>
